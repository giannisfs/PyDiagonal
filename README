Finds left or right Diagonals from a sequence consisting of valid number of elements (valid as a square)

for example 
4x4 =16 
5x5 =25
6x6 =36 
...
Because: 
Any Sequence can be treated as a square as long as the square root of the total number of elements is a positive integer (a natural number)
Coming soon ... (as soon as i have spare  time... grrrrr) :
Determinants of a  valid length sequence ( tread like a square matrix )
and perhaps more
